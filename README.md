# angular-class-recipebook

This project was created by the Udemy Angular class teacher.  I set up this code step by step as I went through the class.  He taught in segments so I learned property binding and the long way of communicating a click event from one component to its parent component then further up to the main parent component then back down to a detail component.  (Click on a recipe within a list of recipes in order to view the detail of that clicked recipe).  This was done using @Input and @Output and EventEmitters.  I set this up on GitHub because I started this class once, got partway through the project and somehow screwed up, got errors regarding NodeModules, couldn't figure out the solution through Google or StackOverflow, and and decided to scrap it and start over.  It was a painful process as I had to go through those class modules again to set the code up.  I put this on GitHub so I can at least just start from where I last saved the project on GitHub if I make a "fatal" error.
